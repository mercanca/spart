 # spart
 A user-oriented partition info command for slurm. It gives a brief view of the cluster.

 Slurm does not have a command showing partition info in a user-friendly way. 
 I wrote a command, I hope you will find it useful.

## Usage

 **Usage: spart [-m] [-a] [-c] [-g] [-i] [-t] [-f] [-s] [-J] [-p PARTITION_LIST] [-l] [-v] [-h]**

 This program shows **the user specific partition info** with core count of available nodes and pending jobs. It hides unnecessary information for users in the output i.e. unusable partitions, undefined limits, unusable nodes etc., but it shows related and usefull information such as how many pending jobs waiting for the resourses or for the other reasons.

 The output of spart without any parameters is as below:

```

The spart command output varies according to cluster configuration to help to the user. You can see very different output of the spart for a different cluster at below. Notice the columns added. Without the spart command, it is very difficult to see the configuration details of the slurm cluster:

 In the **STA-TUS** column, the characters means, the partition is:
```
	*	default partition (default queue),
	.	hidden partition,
	C	closed to both the job submit and run,
	S	closed to the job submit, but the submitted jobs will run,
        r       requires the reservation,
	D	open to the job submit, but the submitted jobs will not run,
	R	open for only root, or closed to root (if you are root),
	A	closed to all of your account(s),
	a	closed to some of your accounts,
	G	closed to all of your group(s),
	g	closed to some of your groups,
	Q	closed to all of your QOS(s),
	q	closed to some of your QOSs.
```

The **RESOURCE PENDING** column shows core counts of pending jobs because of the busy resource.

The **OTHER PENDING** column shows core counts of pending jobs because of the other reasons such
 as license or other limits.

The **YOUR-RUN, PEND-RES, PEND-OTHR**, and **YOUR-TOTL** columns shows the counts of the running,
 resource pending, other pending, and total job count of the current user, respectively.
 If these four columns are have same values, These same values of that four columns will be
 shown at COMMON VALUES as four single values.

The **MIN NODE** and **MAX NODE** columns show the permitted minimum and maximum node counts of the
 jobs which can be submited to the partition.

The **MAXCPU/NODE** column shows the permitted maximum core counts of of the single node in
 the partition.


The **DEFMEM GB/CPU** and **DEFMEM GB/NODE** columns show default maximum memory as GB which a job
 can use for a cpu or a node, respectively.

The **MAXMEM GB/CPU** and **MAXMEM GB/NODE** columns show maximum memory as GB which requestable by
 a job for a cpu or a node, respectively.

The **DEFAULT JOB-TIME** column shows the default time limit of the job which submited to the
 partition without a time limit. If the DEFAULT JOB-TIME limits are not setted, or setted
 same value with MAXIMUM JOB-TIME for all partitions in your cluster, DEFAULT JOB-TIME
 column will not be shown, except -l parameter was given.

The **MAXIMUM JOB-TIME** column shows the maximum time limit of the job which submited to the
 partition. If the user give a time limit further than MAXIMUM JOB-TIME limit of the
 partition, the job will be rejected by the slurm.


The **CORES /NODE** column shows the core count of the node with lowest core count in the
 partition. But if -l was given, both the lowest and highest core counts will be shown.

The **NODE MEM-GB** column shows the memory of the lowest memory node in this partition. But if
 -l parameter was given, both the lowest and highest memory will be shown.

The **QOS NAME** column shows the default qos limits the job which submited to the partition.
 If the QOS NAME of the partition are not setted for all partitions in your cluster, QOS NAME
 column will not be shown, execpt -l parameter was given.

The **GRES (COUNT)** column shows the generic resources of the nodes in the partition, and (in
 paranteses) the total number of nodes in that partition containing that GRES. The GRES (COUNT)
 column will not be shown, execpt -l or -g parameter was given.

If the partition's **QOS NAME, MIN NODES, MAX NODES, MAXCPU/NODE, DEFMEM GB/CPU|NODE,
 MAXMEM GB/CPU|NODE, DEFAULT JOB-TIME**, and **MAXIMUM JOB-TIME** limits are not setted for the
 all partitions in your cluster, corresponding column(s) will not be shown, except -l
 parameter was given.

If the values of a column are same, this column will not be shown at partitions block.
 These same values of that column will be shown at **COMMON VALUES** as a single value.

Parameters:

 **-m**	both the lowest and highest values will be shown in the **CORES /NODE**
		and **NODE MEM-GB** columns.

 **-a**	hidden partitions also be shown.

 **-c**	partitions from federated clusters be shown.

 **-g**	the ouput shows each GRES (gpu, mic etc.) defined in that partition
		and (in paranteses) the total number of nodes in that partition
		containing that GRES.

 **-i** the info about the groups, accounts, QOSs, and queues will be shown.
 
 **-t**	the time info will be shown at DAY-HR:MN format, instead of verbal format.

 **-s** the simple output. spart don't show slurm config columns.

 **-J**	the output does not shown the info about the user's jobs.

 **-f** the ouput shows each FEATURES defined in that partition and (in paranteses)
		the total number of nodes in that partition containing that FEATURES.

 **-p PARTITION_LIST**
	the output shows only the partitions which given with comma-seperated PARTITION_LIST.

 **-l**	all posible columns will be shown, except the federated clusters column.

 **-v** shows info about STATUS LABELS.

 **-h**	shows this usage text.

If you compare the output above with the output with -l parameter (below), unusable and hidden partitions
 were not shown without -l parameter:

## The Cluster and Partition Statements

When STATEMENT feature is on, the spart looks for the statements files. To open the STATEMENT 
 feature, the **SPART_SHOW_STATEMENT** macro must be defined that can be achieved when you 
 uncomment line 24 in spart.h file. If the spart finds any statement file, it shows the content 
 of the files. If the spart can not find a particular staement file, simply ignore it without
 the notification. Therefore, there is no need to recompile to reshow or cancel statements.
 You can edit or remove statement files after compiling. If you want to show again, just write
 new file(s).

The spart also can show the statements using different font sytles and background colors. The 
 style of the cluster's statement and the partitions' statements can be setted differently.

For example, the output at the below shows the cluster statement file exist:
```

   Dear Colleagues,

   Sariyer cluster will be stopped next week, Tuesday, February 14, for scheduled maintenance
   operations. The stop will start at 9:00 a.m. and we expect to bring the cluster back to
   production in the late afternoon. During the course of the maintenance operations, the login
   nodes will not be accessible.

   Best Regards,
   User Support, UHeM

   ============================================================================================
   Dear Colleagues,

   Sariyer cluster will be stopped next week, Tuesday, February 14, for scheduled maintenance
   operations. The stop will start at 9:00 a.m. and we expect to bring the cluster back to
   production in the late afternoon. During the course of the maintenance operations, the login
   nodes will not be accessible.

   Best Regards,
   User Support, UHeM

## Requirements

The spart requires a running slurm which compiled with mysql/mariadb.

Some features of the spart requires Slurm 18.08 or newer. With older versions, the spart works with
 reduced feature set i.e. without showing the federated clusters column and user-spesific output.

Also, with Slurm 20.02.0 and 20.02.1, the slurm have a bug about to connect the slurm database via
 slurm api. Because of that, the spart works with reduced feature set at this version, too.

The spart requires, the slurm configured to give permision for reading other users job info,
 node info, and other information.

The Slurm API, can not run correctly on a "Configless" Slurm node. It looks for slurm.conf, and fails. Because of this reason, the spart can not run a node which does not contain the slurm conf files. But, even at a configless slurm cluster, if a node contains the slurm conf files (for example a slurmctl node), spart works correctly.
 
## Compiling

Compiling is very simple.

If your slurm installed at default location, you can compile the spart command as below:

 ```gcc -lslurm spart.c -o spart```

Don't add optimization flags (-O2 etc.).
 
At before SLURM 19.05, you should compile with **-lslurmdb**:
 
 ```gcc -lslurm -lslurmdb spart.c -o spart```

If the slurm is not installed at default location, you should add locations of the headers and libraries:

 ```gcc -lslurm -lslurmdb spart.c -o spart -I/location/of/slurm/header/files/ -L/location/of/slurm/library/files/```
 
After compiling, you can copy the spart file to the default slurm exe directory which is /usr/bin. Alternatively, you can copy spart file to any directory and you should set PATH environment variable. The default slurm man directory is /usr/share/man/man1/. You can copy the man file (spart.1.gz) to this directory, or you can set MANPATH variable. Don't forget to set reading perpisions of the spart and spart.1.gz files for all users.

Also, there is no need to have administrative rights (being root) to compile and use. If you want to use
 the spart command as a regular user, you can compile and use at your home directory.

Alternatively, If you prefer to compile the spart as a rpm package, you can use the ```rpmbuild``` command:

 ```rpmbuild -ta spart-1.4.3.tar.gz```
 
 
## Reporting Bugs
